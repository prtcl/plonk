plonk is a JavaScript micro-library that provides creative coding essentials like timers, envelopes, and random generators. It is designed to work independently of any specific medium or framework; in Node, the browser, or web workers.

`bower install plonk`

You can then ```var plonk = require('plonk')```, or use the UMD browser build at ```dist/plonk[.min].s```.

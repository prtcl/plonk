# plonk

:warning: v2 is a complete rewrite of the old library and is currently in alpha status :warning:

Tiny library that provides timers, envelopes, and random generators. 

Cool things about plonk:

* Time-based functions that use a familiar generator-inspired API
* Flexible design allows for use in animation loops, creative coding projects, async schedulers, synthesis engines, etc
* Reliable reporting of intervals and elapsed time from every function
* Can be used in React or vanilla JS/TS projects in the browser or Node
* Inspired by the "missing" functions that environments like Max and SuperCollider provide

Development of v2 is ongoing, docs and examples coming soon!
